# Start-Project-Web-Dev

This repo can be used as a starting point for hackathons or personal projects when doing a web app. 
It contains:
* backend project
* frontend project (React)
* frontend project (Angular)

## Backend project

The language used is NodeJs for fast development.

It can use a postgresSQL database that can run in a docker (view docker folder inside the backend project). After you setup de tables inside *init_db.sql* file just run *docker-copose.up*

It already has the logic for the MVC framework with an example of a workflow for registering users into the database.

## Fronted projects

In both projects I implemented the routing logic. Follow the pattern for easy use.
